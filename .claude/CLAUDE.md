# üèóÔ∏è CLAUDE.md - Claude Code Global Configuration

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working across all projects.

## üìã Overview

This is my global Claude Code configuration directory (`~/.claude`) that sets up:
- Professional development standards and workflows
- Language-specific best practices (Go)
- Permission rules for tool usage
- Environment variables for development
- Session history and todo management

## üß† Proactive AI Assistance

### YOU MUST: Always Suggest Improvements
**Every interaction should include proactive suggestions to save engineer time**

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify repeated code patterns and suggest abstractions
   - Detect potential performance bottlenecks before they matter
   - Recognize missing error handling and suggest additions
   - Spot opportunities for parallelization or caching

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Suggest more idiomatic approaches for the language
   - Recommend better library choices based on project needs
   - Propose architectural improvements when patterns emerge
   - Identify technical debt and suggest refactoring plans

3. **Time-Saving Automations**
   - Create scripts for repetitive tasks observed
   - Generate boilerplate code with full documentation
   - Set up GitHub Actions for common workflows
   - Build custom CLI tools for project-specific needs

4. **Documentation Generation**
   - Auto-generate comprehensive documentation (rustdoc, JSDoc, godoc, docstrings)
   - Create API documentation from code
   - Generate README sections automatically
   - Maintain architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Proactive Suggestion Format
```
üí° **Improvement Suggestion**: [Brief title]
**Time saved**: ~X minutes per occurrence
**Implementation**: [Quick command or code snippet]
**Benefits**: [Why this improves the codebase]
```

## üéØ Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Engineer time is precious** - Automate everything possible
- **Quality without bureaucracy** - Smart defaults over process
- **Proactive assistance** - Suggest improvements before asked
- **Self-documenting code** - Generate docs automatically
- **Continuous improvement** - Learn from patterns and optimize

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a principle
- Create tests first based on expected inputs and outputs
- Write only tests, not implementation code
- Run tests and confirm they fail
- Commit when tests are confirmed to be correct
- Then proceed with implementation to make tests pass
- During implementation, do not modify tests, keep fixing code
- Repeat until all tests pass

## üìö AI Assistant Guidelines

### Efficient Professional Workflow
**Smart Explore-Plan-Code-Commit with time-saving automation**

#### 1. EXPLORE Phase (Automated)
- **Use AI to quickly scan and summarize codebase**
- **Auto-identify dependencies and impact areas**
- **Generate dependency graphs automatically**
- **Present findings concisely with actionable insights**

#### 2. PLAN Phase (AI-Assisted)
- **Generate multiple implementation approaches**
- **Auto-create test scenarios from requirements**
- **Predict potential issues using pattern analysis**
- **Provide time estimates for each approach**

#### 3. CODE Phase (Accelerated)
- **Generate boilerplate with full documentation**
- **Auto-complete repetitive patterns**
- **Real-time error detection and fixes**
- **Parallel implementation of independent components**
- **Auto-generate comprehensive comments explaining complex logic**

#### 4. COMMIT Phase (Automated)
```bash
# Language-specific quality checks
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test  # Rust
go fmt ./... && golangci-lint run && go test ./...  # Go
npm run precommit  # TypeScript
uv run --frozen ruff format . && uv run --frozen ruff check . && uv run --frozen pytest  # Python
```

### Documentation & Code Quality Requirements
- **YOU MUST: Generate comprehensive documentation for every function**
- **YOU MUST: Add clear comments explaining business logic**
- **YOU MUST: Create examples in documentation**
- **YOU MUST: Auto-fix all linting/formatting issues**
- **YOU MUST: Generate unit tests for new code**

## üêπ Go Development

### Core Rules
- **Package Manager**: Use Go modules (`go mod`)
- **Naming**: Use short, clear names; avoid stuttering
- **Concurrency**: Prefer channels over shared memory

### Best Practices
- **Context**: First parameter for functions that do I/O
- **Interfaces**: Accept interfaces, return concrete types
- **Defer**: Use for cleanup, but be aware of loop gotchas

## üö´ Security and Quality Standards

### NEVER Rules (Non-negotiable)
- **NEVER: Delete production data without explicit confirmation**
- **NEVER: Hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets**
- **NEVER: Commit code with failing tests or linting errors**
- **NEVER: Push directly to main/master branch**
- **NEVER: Skip security reviews for authentication/authorization code**
- **NEVER: Ignore error returns in Go**

### YOU MUST Rules (Required Standards)
- **YOU MUST: Write tests for new features and bug fixes**
- **YOU MUST: Run CI/CD checks before marking tasks complete**
- **YOU MUST: Follow semantic versioning for releases**
- **YOU MUST: Document breaking changes**
- **YOU MUST: Use feature branches for all development**
- **YOU MUST: Add comprehensive documentation to all public APIs**

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Code Review

### Continuous Analysis
**AI should continuously analyze code and suggest improvements**

```
üîç Code Analysis Results:
- Performance: Found 3 optimization opportunities
- Security: No issues detected
- Maintainability: Suggest extracting 2 methods
- Test Coverage: 85% ‚Üí Suggest 3 additional test cases
- Documentation: 2 functions missing proper docs
```

Remember: **Engineer time is gold** - Automate everything, document comprehensively, and proactively suggest improvements. Every interaction should save time and improve code quality.
