## Development Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a principle
- Create tests first based on expected inputs and outputs
- Write only tests, not implementation code
- Run tests and confirm they fail
- Commit when tests are confirmed to be correct
- Then proceed with implementation to make tests pass
- During implementation, do not modify tests, keep fixing code
- Repeat until all tests pass
